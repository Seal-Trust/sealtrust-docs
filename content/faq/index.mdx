# Frequently Asked Questions

Common questions about SealTrust answered in plain language.

## General Questions

### What is SealTrust?

SealTrust is a **cryptographic verification and encrypted storage platform** for AI training datasets. It provides a way to prove that a dataset is authentic, unmodified, and stored securely - all without requiring trust in any single party.

Think of it like a notary service for data, but instead of trusting a person, you trust math (cryptography) and hardware (secure enclaves).

### What problem does SealTrust solve?

**The trust problem in AI data.**

When you download a dataset for AI training, how do you know:
- It hasn't been tampered with?
- It's the same data the uploader originally shared?
- Only authorized people can access it?

SealTrust solves this by:
1. **Hashing** the original data (creating a unique fingerprint)
2. **Encrypting** it so only authorized wallets can access it
3. **Verifying** the metadata in a secure hardware environment
4. **Recording** everything on-chain as an immutable record

### Is SealTrust a marketplace?

**No.** SealTrust is a verification and storage platform, not a marketplace.

We don't facilitate buying or selling datasets. We provide the infrastructure to:
- Prove dataset authenticity
- Store datasets securely
- Control who can access them

You can think of us as the "trust layer" that marketplaces or data providers can build on top of.

### Who is SealTrust for?

- **AI Researchers** who need to verify training data integrity
- **Data Providers** who want to prove their datasets are authentic
- **Organizations** that need auditable data provenance
- **Anyone** who needs secure, verifiable data storage

## How It Works

### What happens when I register a dataset?

Here's the 6-step process in plain English:

| Step | What Happens | Why It Matters |
|------|--------------|----------------|
| 1. **Hash** | We calculate a SHA-256 hash of your original (unencrypted) file | Creates a unique fingerprint - if even one byte changes, the hash changes |
| 2. **Encrypt** | Your file is encrypted using Seal | Only wallets you authorize can decrypt it |
| 3. **Upload** | The encrypted file goes to Walrus | Decentralized storage - no single point of failure |
| 4. **Verify** | Metadata is verified inside a TEE (Trusted Execution Environment) | Hardware-backed proof that verification was done correctly |
| 5. **Record** | A DatasetNFT is created on Sui blockchain | Immutable record that can never be altered |
| 6. **Access** | Authorized users can download and decrypt | Only wallets on your allowlist can access the data |

### What is a TEE?

**TEE** stands for **Trusted Execution Environment**. It's a secure area of a processor that:
- Runs code in isolation from the rest of the system
- Cannot be accessed by the operating system, hypervisor, or even the cloud provider
- Produces cryptographic proof (attestation) of what code is running

SealTrust uses **AWS Nitro Enclaves**, Amazon's TEE technology. When we verify your dataset metadata, even AWS employees cannot see or tamper with the process.

### What are PCR measurements?

**PCR** stands for **Platform Configuration Register**. These are cryptographic hashes that prove exactly what code is running inside the TEE.

| PCR | What It Measures |
|-----|------------------|
| **PCR0** | Hash of the enclave image file |
| **PCR1** | Hash of the Linux kernel |
| **PCR2** | Hash of the application binary |

Before trusting a verification, you can check that the PCR values match what's registered on-chain. This proves the enclave is running the exact code we published.

### What is Seal encryption?

**Seal** is a threshold encryption system built for Sui. Instead of a single key that could be stolen, Seal splits the decryption capability across multiple independent servers.

Key features:
- **Threshold decryption**: Need 2 out of 3 servers to decrypt (configurable)
- **On-chain access control**: Your smart contract decides who can decrypt
- **No single point of failure**: Even if one server is compromised, data stays safe

### What is Walrus?

**Walrus** is a decentralized storage network. Unlike traditional cloud storage:
- No single company controls your data
- Data is split across many nodes
- You get a unique `blob_id` to retrieve your data later

SealTrust stores encrypted datasets on Walrus, so even the storage providers can't read your data.

## Security Questions

### Can SealTrust read my data?

**No.** Your data is encrypted before it leaves your browser. We never see the unencrypted content.

The encryption flow:
1. You select a file in your browser
2. Browser calculates hash of original file
3. Browser encrypts the file with Seal
4. Only the encrypted blob is uploaded

### Can AWS access data in the enclave?

**No.** AWS Nitro Enclaves are designed so that even AWS administrators cannot access the memory or code inside a running enclave.

The enclave:
- Has no persistent storage
- Cannot be debugged in production
- Communicates only through a secure channel (vsock)
- Generates fresh keys on every boot

### What if SealTrust disappears?

Your data is safe because:

1. **Encrypted data is on Walrus** - decentralized storage that doesn't depend on us
2. **Records are on Sui blockchain** - immutable and public
3. **Seal keys are distributed** - no single party controls decryption

The only thing you'd lose is the verification service. Your data and access control would continue to work.

### What if someone gets the original hash?

The hash is public - it's stored on-chain. **This is intentional.**

A hash lets you verify data, but it doesn't let you recreate the data. Think of it like a fingerprint - knowing someone's fingerprint doesn't tell you what they look like.

## Technical Questions

### What blockchain does SealTrust use?

**Sui** - a high-performance Layer 1 blockchain. We chose Sui because:
- Fast finality (transactions confirm in ~500ms)
- Low gas fees
- Native support for complex objects (our DatasetNFT)
- Great developer tooling (Move language)

### What are the on-chain objects?

| Object | Purpose | ID |
|--------|---------|-----|
| **SealTrust Package** | Main smart contract | [`0xcdc25...e4e`](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/package/0xcdc25c90e328f2905c97c01e90424395dd7b10e67769fc8f4ae62b87f1e63e4e) |
| **Seal Allowlist** | Access control logic | [`0x70593...925`](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/package/0x705937d7b0ffc7c37aa23a445ed52ae521a47adcdffa27fe965e0b73464a9925) |
| **EnclaveConfig** | Registered PCR values | [`0x55d6a...c32`](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/object/0x55d6a15a5e8822b39f76dc53031d83beddc1e5b0e3ef804b82e8d4bfe4fbdc32) |
| **Enclave** | Enclave public key | [`0x611b8...5ec`](https://testnet.suivision.xyz/object/0x611b83f2b4d97471a6c164877ff23a2f0570806baf3d9380d1f11433a2b685ec) |

### How do I verify a dataset?

1. **Get the original file** from the data provider
2. **Calculate its SHA-256 hash** (use any standard tool)
3. **Compare** with the `original_hash` stored on-chain

If they match, the file is authentic and unmodified.

```bash
# Example: Calculate hash on Mac/Linux
shasum -a 256 myfile.csv
```

### What file formats are supported?

Any file format works. SealTrust doesn't care about file contents - we hash and encrypt any binary data.

Common use cases:
- CSV, JSON, Parquet (tabular data)
- Images (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
- Text files
- Archives (ZIP, TAR)

### Is there a file size limit?

The practical limits depend on:
- **Walrus**: Currently handles files up to several GB
- **Browser**: Large files may be slow to hash/encrypt in-browser

For very large datasets, consider splitting into chunks.

## Usage Questions

### Do I need a wallet?

**Yes.** You need a Sui-compatible wallet to:
- Sign transactions
- Register datasets
- Access encrypted data

Recommended wallets:
- [Sui Wallet](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sui-wallet/)
- [Suiet](https://suiet.app/)
- [Ethos](https://ethoswallet.xyz/)

### How much does it cost?

Costs include:
- **Sui gas fees** - typically a few cents per transaction
- **Walrus storage fees** - depends on file size and storage duration
- **SealTrust** - currently free during testnet

### Is this on mainnet?

**Not yet.** SealTrust is currently deployed on **Sui Testnet**.

Testnet means:
- Free to use (testnet SUI has no real value)
- May have bugs or downtime
- Data may be wiped during upgrades

We'll announce mainnet launch when ready.

### How do I get testnet SUI?

Use the Sui faucet:
1. Go to [faucet.sui.io](https://faucet.sui.io)
2. Connect your wallet
3. Request testnet SUI

Or use the CLI:
```bash
sui client faucet
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Nautilus unavailable" error

The TEE verification service might be down. Check:
1. [Status page](https://nautilus.sealtrust.app/health) - should return "OK"
2. Try again in a few minutes
3. Contact us if it persists

### Transaction failed

Common causes:
- **Insufficient gas** - get more testnet SUI from faucet
- **Network congestion** - try again
- **Invalid signature** - the TEE signature didn't verify (rare)

### Hash mismatch when verifying

If your calculated hash doesn't match the on-chain hash:
- The file has been modified
- You're hashing the encrypted file instead of the original
- The file was corrupted during download
