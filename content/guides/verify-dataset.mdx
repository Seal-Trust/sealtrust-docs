# Verify a Dataset

Learn how to verify if a dataset has been registered on SealTrust.

## Why Verify?

Verification confirms:
- The dataset exists in the SealTrust registry
- The data hasn't been tampered with
- When and by whom it was registered

## Verification Methods

### Method 1: Upload File

1. Go to [sealtrust.app/verify](https://sealtrust.app/verify)
2. Select "Upload File"
3. Choose your dataset file
4. Click "Compute Hash & Verify"

The system computes the SHA-256 hash and searches the blockchain.

### Method 2: Enter URL

1. Go to [sealtrust.app/verify](https://sealtrust.app/verify)
2. Select "Enter URL"
3. Paste the dataset URL
4. Click "Compute Hash & Verify"

### Method 3: Enter Hash

If you already have the hash:

1. Go to [sealtrust.app/verify](https://sealtrust.app/verify)
2. Select "Enter Hash"
3. Paste the 64-character SHA-256 hash
4. Verification runs automatically

## Understanding Results

```
Status: VERIFIED
Name: ImageNet Training Set v1
Format: PARQUET
