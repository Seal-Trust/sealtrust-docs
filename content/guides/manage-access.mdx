# Manage Access

Control who can decrypt your registered datasets using Seal allowlists.

## Access Control Overview

SealTrust uses **Seal threshold encryption** with **allowlist-based access control**:

- Each dataset has an associated allowlist
- Only addresses on the allowlist can decrypt
- The dataset owner has admin capabilities

## Adding Users

import { Steps } from 'nextra/components'

<Steps>

### Navigate to Dataset

Go to your dataset's management page at `sealtrust.app/dataset/[id]`.

### Open Access Management

Click the "Access Management" tab.

### Add Address

1. Click "Add User"
2. Enter the Sui wallet address
3. Click "Add to Allowlist"
4. Sign the transaction

</Steps>

## Removing Users

<Steps>

### Navigate to Access Management

Go to your dataset's Access Management tab.

### Remove Address

1. Find the user in the list
2. Click the remove button
3. Confirm and sign the transaction

</Steps>

## Checking Authorization

To check if an address is authorized:

```typescript
import { allowlistService } from '@/lib/allowlist-service';

const isAuthorized = await allowlistService.isAuthorized(
  allowlistId,
  userAddress,
  suiClient
);
```

## Viewing All Members

```typescript
const members = await allowlistService.getAllowlistMembers(
  allowlistId,
  suiClient
);

console.log('Authorized addresses:', members);
```

## Best Practices

> [!TIP]
> **Security Recommendations:**
> - Regularly audit your allowlist
> - Remove access when no longer needed
> - Use specific addresses, not wildcards
> - Keep your admin capability secure

## Technical Details

The allowlist is a shared Sui object:

```move
public struct Allowlist has key {
    id: UID,
    name: String,
    list: vector<address>,
}

public struct Cap has key {
    id: UID,
    allowlist_id: ID,
}
```

- `Allowlist` - Shared object containing authorized addresses
- `Cap` - Admin capability for managing the allowlist
